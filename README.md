# AnonBot
By Edric Antoine
A Python bot that uses the Reddit API to send users inspiring messages.

When a message includes 'What would Anon do?', the bot uses the Reddit API to fetch the title of a random one of the 25 newest posts on r/greentext, and 
sends it in a message.

This project was mostly created for my own learning of how APIs and JSON work with the Python language.
